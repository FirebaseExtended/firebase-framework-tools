## Overview

Firebase Hosting integrates with popular modern web frameworks including Angular and Next.js. Using Firebase Hosting and
Cloud Functions for Firebase with these frameworks, you can develop apps and microservices in your preferred framework
environment, and then deploy them in a managed, secure server environment. Support during this early preview includes
the following functionality:

* Deploy Web apps comprised of static web content
* Deploy Web apps that use pre-rendering / Static Site Generation (SSG)
* Deploy Web apps that use server-side Rendering (SSR)â€”full server rendering on demand

Firebase provides this functionality through the Firebase CLI. When initializing Hosting on the command line, you
provide information about your new or existing Web project, and the CLI sets up the right resources for your chosen Web
framework.

We'd love to learn from you. [Express your interest in helping us shape the future of Firebase Hosting here.](https://goo.gle/41enW5X)

## Status

![Status: Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Experimental-blue)

This repository is maintained by Google but is not a supported Firebase product. Issues here are answered by
maintainers and other community members on GitHub on a best-effort basis.

[Please open issues related to Web Frameworks support in Firease CLI in the firebase-tools repository](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues/new/choose).

## Enable framework-awareness

An experimental add-on to the Firebase CLI provides web framework support. To enable it, call the following:

```shell
firebase experiments:enable webframeworks
```

## Prerequisites

- Firebase CLI version 10.9.1 or later (see installation instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli))


## Initialize Firebase Hosting

When you initialize Firebase Hosting it should automatically detect known Web Frameworks, if one isn't discovered
you'll be given a list of supported frameworks to start with.

```shell
firebase init hosting
```

You should see the "source" option in your `firebase.json` rather than the traditional "public". This points to the
root directory of your application's source code, relative to your `firebase.json`.

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "source": ".",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "frameworksBackend": {
      "region": "us-central1"
    }
  }
}
```

## Serve locally

You can test your integration locally by following these steps:

1. Run `firebase emulators:start` from the terminal. This should build your app and serve it using the Firebase CLI.
2. Open your web app at the local URL returned by the CLI (usually http://localhost:5000).

## Deploy your app to Firebase Hosting

When you're ready to share your changes with the world, deploy your app to your live site:

1. Run `firebase deploy` from the terminal. This will build your application, determine if a backend is needed, and if so build and deploy a Cloud Function for you.
3. Check your website on: `SITE_ID.web.app` or `PROJECT_ID.web.app` (or your custom domain, if you set one up)

## Configuring your backend

In your `firebase.json` you can alter the configuration of the code-generated Cloud Function by editing the "frameworksBackend"
option. "frameworksBackend" takes the same options as [firebase-functions/v2/https.httpsOptions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/functions/2nd-gen/node/firebase-functions.https.httpsoptions)
though JSON-serializable. E.g,


```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "source": ".",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "frameworksBackend": {
      "region": "us-central1",
      "minInstances": 1,
      "maxInstances": 10
    }
  }
}
```
