### Scenarios Tested

<!-- 

Write a list of all the user journeys and edge cases you've tested. 

For framework adapters:

At a minimum this should mean that you've run the code locally via 

npx ts-node --esm=true  path/to/adapter/build/.../@apphosting/adapter${adapter name}/src/bin/build.ts

For more complex changes testing with the buildpacks (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/buildpacks) + verdaccio setup from this pr https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/firebase-framework-tools/pull/170 
is recommended to make everything works end to end
