    <h2>Server Side Rendering (SSR)</h2>
    <p>Dynamic content is generated by the server running on Cloud Functions. Improve performance, SEO and achieve better Core Web Vitals results.
      Visit <a href="ssr">/ssr</a> to see the Angular SSR in action.</p>

    <h2>Prerendering (SSG)</h2>
    <p>Prerendering maintains the same performance benefits of server-side rendering (SSR) but achieves a reduced Time to First Byte (TTFB),
      ultimately enhancing user experience. The key distinction lies in its approach that pages are served as static content, and there is no request-based rendering.
      Visit <a href="ssg">/ssg</a> page to see a statically generated page served by Firebase Hosting.</p>

    <h2>Deferrable Views</h2>
    <p>
      Take advantage of one of the most important features of Angular from recent releases.
      Deferrable views are a powerful tool that can be used to reduce the initial bundle size of your application or defer heavy components that may not ever be loaded until a later time.
      Visit <a routerLink="deferrable-views">/defer</a> page to see defer in Action.
