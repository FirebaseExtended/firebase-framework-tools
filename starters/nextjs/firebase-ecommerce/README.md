# Firebase E-Commerce Project

This project is a Firebase-based e-commerce application designed for developers to bootstrap their e-commerce projects. Below is the documentation to help you set up, provision, and maintain the application.

## Overview

The application provides a quick and easy to use shopping experience with features like:

- Firebase Authentication for user sign-up, sign-in, and management.
- Product and collection management of assets with Firebase Storage.
- Real-time database connections using Firebase Data Connect.
- Checkout and payment processing through Stripe.
- Dynamic pages for collections, products, and orders.

## Setup and Configuration

### Firebase Setup

#### Firebase Auth

1. Create a new Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Enable **Email/Password Authentication**.
3. Add Firebase app secrets to `.env.local`.
4. Include Firebase app secrets in **App Hosting**.

#### Firebase Data Connect

1. Install the **Firebase Data Connect** extension for VS Code.
2. Create a new Data Connect instance and service.
3. Set up billing for the Firebase project.
4. Switch to the Blaze plan.
5. Define the required schema, queries, and mutations.
6. Deploy the schema, queries, and mutations to production.

#### Firebase Storage

1. Create a new Storage bucket.
2. Use the bucket to store images for products and collections.

#### Firebase App Hosting

1. Connect the Firebase app to your GitHub repository.
2. Create a new backend for the application.
3. Deploy secrets to app hosting using the Firebase CLI.
4. Deploy the application to Firebase Hosting.

### Stripe Setup

1. Create a new Stripe account.
2. Add API keys (Publishable and Secret) to `.env.local`.
3. Set up a webhook endpoint in the Firebase project.
4. Add the webhook secret to `.env.local`.
5. Deploy webhook configurations using the Firebase CLI.
6. Customize the webhook to handle required Stripe events.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be configured in `.env.local`:

- **Firebase Secrets**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`.
- **Stripe Secrets**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUB_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- **Google/Gemini API Key**: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

## Security and Firebase Rules

For an e-commerce app handling user data and transactions, security is critical:

1. Make sure you enable the correct Firebase security rules for Firestore/RealtimeDatabase and Storage.
2. Keep your environment variable secrets private. Do not commit them to Git.
3. Rotate your Firebase, Stripe, and Google API keys periodically.
4. Implement user authentication checks (via Firebase Auth) before reading or writing sensitive data.
