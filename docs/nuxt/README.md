# Nuxt on Firebase App Hosting

Nuxt support on Firebase App Hosting is powered by the [community-supported Nitro preset](/projects/FirebaseExtended/firebase-framework-tools::docs::nuxt).

> **Community-supported:** While built in collaboration with Firebase App Hosting, the Nitro preset is not currently an official Google Cloud product. Support is best-effort only.
